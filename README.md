    Server-side rendering.  Oh yeah.

3. **Airtable**

    Most of the data on this website is stored on Airtable, allowing the staff to change the content of the site without having to know anything about the wild world of JS/HTML/CSS. This site makes extensive use of Airtable's javascript library.
